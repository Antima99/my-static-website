      Bingo originated in 16th century Italy as "Il Gioco del Lotto dâ€™Italia,"
      a lottery game played by the elite. By the 18th century, it had reached
      France, where it was called "Le Lotto" and became a favorite among the
      aristocracy. Its popularity spread across Europe before reaching the
      United States in the 1920s.

      In America, Edwin S. Lowe, a toy salesman, modernized the game and
      renamed it "Bingo." He collaborated with mathematician Carl Leffler to
      create thousands of unique Bingo cards. The game quickly became a
      sensation, played in churches, community centers, and even military
      camps during World War II.

      Today, Bingo continues to evolve. From traditional halls to online
      platforms, the game remains a symbol of fun and camaraderie for people
      across the globe.
